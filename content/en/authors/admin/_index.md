I am Axel Lorenzen-Zabel, a versatile geography graduate with a passion for the interfaces between mobility, technology and society.

<!-- My professional journey has taken me through various exciting stations:

* **deeeper.technology GmbH**: I am currently optimizing access to geodata at [deeeper.technology](https://www.deeeper-technology.de) to ensure that both employees and machines can work with it efficiently.
* **Datenverarbeitungszentrum Mecklenburg-Vorpommern**: As an expert in geoinformation, I provided public geoservices here and ensured that important data was accessible to citizens, institutions and companies.
* **University of Rostock**: Here, as part of the <a href="https://bmdv.bund.de/goto?id=351066">mFUND</a>-project <a href="https://www.opengeoedu.de/"><img alt="small opengeoedu logo" style="display:inline;margin:auto" width="20" src="https://www.opengeoedu.de/images/logo/oge.svg"> OpenGeoEdu</a>, I developed an innovative learning platform for the promotion and use of open data and open software in geospatial study programs. -->

My experience in research, teaching, public service and industry enables me to look at complex challenges from different angles and develop customized solutions.

Let's shape the future together!
