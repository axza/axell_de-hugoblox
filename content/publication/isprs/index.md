abstract: This article presents the concept, implementation and results of the project "OpenGeoEdu", an open and web-based educational resource on Remote Sensing and GIS. OpenGeoEdu is focused on the use of open geodata in spatially oriented study courses. Teachers and students in the German-speaking countries are to be offered an open learning environment hoping to increase the motivation of students and researchers by dealing with current societal relevant issues. OpenGeoEdu is available at www.opengeoedu.de, has been offered as a MOOC since October 2018 and is being continuously expanded and developed. In addition, an umbrella portal of the portals on open geodata is available to quickly get an overview of the data offered. Four partners from universities, non-university research institutions as well as federal research authorities with R&D tasks are collaborating in this project offering case studies for teaching and education based on their experiences in a wide range of spatial applications.
summary: This article presents the concept, implementation and results of the project "OpenGeoEdu", an open and web-based educational resource on Remote Sensing and GIS.
